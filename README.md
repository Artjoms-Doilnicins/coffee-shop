This project is a simple coffee shop order page that showcases items, allows users to input their name and payment details, and provides a breakdown of the total cost including tax and subtotal.

## Features

### HTML

The structure consists of the following main sections:
1. **Header**: Displays a coffee cup icon and the "Coffee Shop" title.
   
2. **Items Section**: Lists three items: Cappuccino, Latte, and Croissant, each with a quantity, description, and price.
   
3. **User Input Section**: Includes fields for entering the customer's name and payment details (card number and CCV).

4. **Total Section**: Displays the subtotal, tax, and total amount to be paid.
   
5. **Order Button**: A button to place the order.

### CSS

The page uses modern design practices with a clean, minimalist look and subtle animations. It is responsive, with flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Root Variables** : Root CSS variables are used to define the primary colors, font sizes, and shadow effects. This allows for easy customization and consistency across the page:
 
- **Body Background** : The page uses a coffee shop-themed background image that is fixed and covers the entire screen:
 
- **Header** : The header features a logo (coffee icon) and a title in a clean, centered layout with a subtle shadow and rounded corners for a polished look.

- **Item Section** : Items are displayed with a price and brief description. Each item is styled with flexbox to ensure a clean, easy-to-read layout.

- **Input Fields** : Styled with rounded edges and light borders for a clean, modern look.

- **Total Section** : The subtotal, tax, and total amounts are displayed in a neatly aligned row with bold labels and underlined total price.
